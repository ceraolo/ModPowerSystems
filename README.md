# ModPowerSystems
  
ModPowerSystems is a free package that is developed with the Modelica language from the [Modelica Association](https://www.Modelica.org).
It provides models for power systems components in several domains:
* Static phasors 
* Dynamic phasors 
* Electromagnetic transient (EMT) 

# About this fork
This fork, in addition to converting the library to the usage of MSL 4.0.0 instead of 3.2.2, up to now has only visual corrections, to make diagrams more compliant to de-facto Modelica standard, and this repository's owner preferences.
No new code or behaviour added insofar.
This justifies not changing its name, according to the "Modelica License 2" rules.
In case in future new models are added, they will be confined in specific folders (i.e. subpackages) so that no confusion will exist between the original work and the new additions.

## Usage
ModPowerSystems is tested with OpenModelica and Dymola and should load correctly if the [Modelica Standard Library 4.x.x](https://github.com/modelica/Modelica) is available.
